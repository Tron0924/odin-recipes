    <h3>Taco Shells:</h3>
    <p>You can use whichever you like as the shell but for this recipe we are going to use 8 White Corn Tortillas.</p>

    <h2>Instructions:</h2>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Cook Ground Beef:</strong> Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add the ground beef. Break the beef up with a wooden spoon while cooking. 
            <br>Cook the ground beef fully, until browned and no longer pink.</li>
        <li><strong>Drain:</strong> Drain any excess grease from the skillet. Then return to the stove and reduce the heat to low.</li>
        <li><strong>Season:</strong> Add the 1/2 cup tomato sauce and taco seasoning. Stir together until the meat is coated in the sauce.</li>
        <li><strong>Simmer:</strong> Allow to simmer for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Fry Tortillas:</strong> Pour 1/2 cup oil in a medium size skillet, heat over medium high heat. Carefully dip a tortilla, <br>if the oil sizzles and bubbles then it's hot enough. Gently lay the tortilla in the oil and fry each side for about 30 seconds, <br>just enough to give some color and add some crispness.</li>
        <li><strong>Shape Tortillas:</strong> Remove the tortilla to a paper towel to absorb oil, and carefully fold the tortilla over to create a taco shape. <br>I do this with my tongs, or two forks, whatever I'm using to lay the tortillas in the oil and remove them.</li>
        <li><strong>Toppings:</strong> Fill the tortillas with the ground beef taco meat and add desired toppings.</li>
    </ol>
