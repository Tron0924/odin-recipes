Recipe by <a href="https://www.aspicyperspective.com/about/">Sommer Collier</a>.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients: </h2>

    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds ground chuck</li>
        <li>½ cup crushed saltine crackers or breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons milk</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions: </h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Set out a large mixing bowl. Add in the ground beef, crushed crackers, egg, Worcestershire sauce,<br> milk, salt, garlic powder, onion powder, and pepper. Mix by hand until the meat mixture is smooth,<br> but stop once the mixture looks even. (Over mixing can create a dense heavy texture.)</li>
        <li>Press the meat down in the bowl, into an even disk. Use a knife to cut and divide the hamburger patty<br> mixture into 6(1/3 pound grill or skillet patties), or 12 thin griddle patties.</li>
        <li>Set out a baking sheet, lined with wax paper or foil, to hold the patties. One at a time, gather the patty mix<br> and press firmly into patties. Shape them just slightly larger than the buns you plan to use, to account for<br> shrinkage during cooking. Set the patties on the baking sheet. Use a spoon to press a dent in the center<br> of each patty so they don't puff up as they cook. If you need to stack the patties separate them with a sheet of wax paper.</li>
        <li>Preheat the grill or a skillet to medium heat. (Approximately 350-400 degrees F.)</li>
        <li><strong>For thick patties:</strong> Grill or fry the patties for 3-4 minutes per side.</li>
        <li><strong>For thin patties:</strong> Cook on the griddle for 2 minutes per side.</li>
        <li>Stack the hot patties on hamburgers buns, and top with your favorite hamburgers toppings. Serve warm.</li>
